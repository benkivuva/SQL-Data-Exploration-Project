# **SQL Data Exploration Project**



This project was developed using SQL Server and imported data from an Excel file. The project focuses on basic SQL skills, including:

- Joining tables: combining data from multiple tables based on a common column.
- Grouping by data: grouping data based on one or more columns to perform calculations.
- Updating data: modifying data within a table using SQL's UPDATE statement.
- Aliasing: assigning a temporary name to a table or column to make the SQL code easier to read.
- Partitioning: dividing a table into smaller, more manageable sections based on a specific column or set of columns.
- Creating CTE: creating a named temporary result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
- Views: creating a virtual table that pulls data from one or more tables in a database.
- Temporary tables: creating a table that exists temporarily within the database session.
- Subqueries: embedding one SELECT statement within another SELECT statement.
